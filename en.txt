[15]: Allan: It's pretty small, Lizzie. A wife, two children, a dog, a hamster, and of course, the in-laws.
[16]: Lizzie: A hamster?
[17]: Allan: Now that we've gone through the conversation, what do you say we run through some of the vocabulary?
[18]: Lizzie: Sounds like a good idea.
[19]: Allan: So let's begin with…

[45]: Lizzie: Introduced
[46]: Allan: In Spanish, you'll find that many words end in ADO, A-D-O, and IDO, I-D-O, just like we see here in presenter.
[47]: Lizzie: Or like talked and eaten.
[48]: Alan: Exactly. Now, the thing is when we're speaking quickly, it's not uncommon to kind of drop that letter D in the ending and say presenteo.
[49]: VOCAB AND PHRASE USAGE
[50]: Lizzie: introduce me
[51]: Allan: But it's probably something you should get in the habit of hearing more than saying.
[52]: Lizzie: Now let's look at how some of these words were used in today's conversation.
[53]: Allan: Where do you want to start?
[54]: Lizzie: Let's start with the noun brother.
[55]: Allan: Alright, and this noun can be either masculine, brother, or feminine, sister.
[56]: Lizzie: And as a masculine noun, 'what does it mean?
[57]: Allan: As a masculine noun, it means “brother” in the singular, that is. In the plural it has two meanings.
[58]: Lizzie: And what are they?
[59]: Allan: Well, it can mean “brothers”, which should come as no surprise, but it can also mean siblings since in Spanish the masculine plural is preferred to make up for the lack of a neutral form. So when we're talking about a group of males and females, we'll use the masculine plural form.
[60]: Lizzie: And the feminine noun?
[61]: Allan: That just means “sister” in the singular and “sisters” in the plural.
[62]: Lizzie: Brother, brothers, sister, sisters.
[63]: Allan: Lizzie, what's the name of your uncle's son?
[64]: Lizzie: His name is Pablo.
[65]: Allen: Really?
[66]: Lizzie: He's my cousin.
[67]: Allan: So the son of your uncle is your cousin, your cousin. This is a great word. Aside from referring to someone in your family, it’s also used to refer to what we might call in English a family friend or extended family.
[68]: Lizzie: Right. Like if you're invited over to my house and my cousins ​​meet you. They might start calling you primo to make you feel like you're part of the family.
[69]: Allan: Right. That's so nice. And with this one, too, we can use it as a masculine or feminine noun, even though we'll always translate it as "cousin".
[70]: Lizzie: Cousin, cousins, cousin, cousins.
[71]: Allan: So, moving on, what's another way to refer to the son of your uncle?
[72]: Lizzie: is the son of my uncle.
[73]: Allan: Hey, we're on a roll. Another noun that can be either masculine or feminine. And this one, like brother, has two different translations depending on the gender.
[74]: Lizzie: The masculine son form.
[75]: Allan: So in the masculine singular this means “son”, and in the feminine, Lizzie?
[76]: Lizzie: Daughter.
[77]: Alan: "Daughter." But, again, when we're talking about sons and daughters, we're going to need to use the masculine plural form children, and this means "children."
[78]: Lizzie: Alright, last word.
[79]: Allan: Let's go for four in a row.
[80]: Lizzie: Why not!
[81]: Allan: Uncle and aunt.
[82]: Lizzie: Well, it's nothing more than “uncle” and “aunt”.
[83]: Allan: And your uncles. How do you say uncles in English?
[84]: Lizzie: I prefer not to answer. Can we talk about something else?
[85]: Allan: Come on. No, it's an unfair question. There's no clean translation for the word uncles. We have to describe it and say "aunts and uncles."
[86]: Lizzie: Let's continue with the grammar. .
